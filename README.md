### Documentation

You can find the documentation [here](https://www.archerapi.com/documentation/).

### Support

If you'd like to support the cost of maintaining this project's infrastructure you can do so [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ben93).

It would be great to see some community libraries so if that's of interest to you I encourage you to build something in whatever language
and let me know so I can link here and in the API documentation.
