[Archer API](https://www.archerapi.com/) is a REST API that provides data about the adult animated spy comedy [Archer](https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/archer).

For example, to get a random quote you can acess this endpoint: 

```bash

curl https://archerapi.com/api/quotes/random

```

Response:

```
{
  "character": "Algernop Krieger",
  "episode": "The Papal Chase",
  "id": 25,
  "quote": "Jazz hands!"
}
```
